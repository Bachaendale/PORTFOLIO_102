            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>As an undergraduate, I've actively contributed to various projects, showcasing my proficiency in web
                development, particularly in HTML, CSS, and SQL database projects. My involvement has been instrumental
                in developing interactive and user-friendly websites using HTML and CSS, ensuring an aesthetically
                pleasing and responsive design.
                <br>

                Furthermore, my engagements extend to SQL database projects where I have demonstrated expertise in
                creating, managing, and optimizing databases. I've contributed to building robust database structures,
                implementing efficient querying methods, and ensuring data integrity and security.

                <br>

                Through these experiences, I've gained valuable insights into the principles of front-end web
                development (HTML, CSS) and back-end database management (SQL), honing my skills to bring innovative
                solutions and contribute effectively to project teams. These opportunities have provided me with
                hands-on experience, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical settings and contribute
                meaningfully to diverse projects.
